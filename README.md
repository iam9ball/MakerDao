# MakerDao

MakerDao is a decentralized protocol that issues a stablecoin called Venom. Users create Collateral Debt Positions (CDPs) by depositing approved collateral, as determined by the governance body known as Ancestors, and minting Venom. The system ensures stability by always being overcollateralized, meaning the collateral provided by users backs the stablecoin to maintain its peg to the dollar and uphold trust in the system.

## Key Components

### 1. Collateral Debt Position (CDP)
Users can mint Venom up to a certain threshold based on the volatility of their collateral. It's crucial not to exceed this threshold to avoid liquidation if the collateral's value drops. If a user falls below the threshold, a keeper is incentivized to liquidate the position through a Dutch auction, selling the collateral until the debt and penalty fees are covered. Any remaining balance can be redeemed by the user, who will then exit the debt position.

### 2. Engine
The Engine contract manages the entire MakerDao system. Owned by the TimeLock contract under governance control (Ancestors), it inherits from the Crowdsale and EarlyAdopters contracts. Users initially interact with the EarlyAdopters contract by depositing approved collateral within a set duration into the Engine vault. Governance tokens (Viper) can be claimed for free after the Crowdsale based on contribution percentage. During the Crowdsale, users can buy Viper tokens, with the price algorithmically determined by the collateral in the Engine vault and the total supply of Venom tokens. Remaining Viper tokens are burned if unsold, ensuring adequate initial collateral and creating value for the governance token. The Crowdsale funds are reserved for insolvency scenarios.

### 3. Ancestors
Ancestors is the governance contract where Viper holders can vote on proposals. Any address can propose changes, but only Viper holders can vote to implement them. The TimeLock contract executes approved proposals, with Ancestors setting the TimeLock parameters. Users can propose changes to system risk parameters, which are then voted on by Viper holders.

### 4. TimeLock
The TimeLock contract executes changes to risk parameters as voted by Viper holders after a set delay period.

### 5. Auction
The Auction contract handles the liquidation process through a Dutch auction. Collateral from liquidation positions is sold until the debt and penalty fees are covered. If the required amount isn't raised within the timeframe, the auction restarts with the initial price. Venom tokens used to purchase collateral are burned, and any remaining collateral is transferred to the Engine for user redemption.

### 6. EarlyAdopters
EarlyAdopters contract rewards early users with Viper tokens. Users deposit allowed tokens within the contract's duration and can claim rewards based on their contribution percentage after the Crowdsale. Tokens are distributed for free, but users can't exceed a certain percentage of the total token distribution.

### 7. Crowds sale
The Crowdsale contract sells Viper tokens to users, who purchase them with allowed tokens. The price is algorithmically determined based on the collateral in the Engine vault and the total supply of Viper tokens. The more tokens purchased, the higher the price, creating value and stability for the governance token.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To fork and run this project locally, you need the following:

- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) installed
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed

### Installation

Follow these steps to fork, compile, and test the project on your local machine:

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Fork the [MakerDao]([Link to the MakerDao Repository](https://github.com/iam9ball/MakerDao)).

2. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iam9ball/MakerDao
   cd MakerDao
   ```

3. **Install Foundry**
   - Install Foundry by following the [Foundry installation guide](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation).
   - Ensure you have `forge` and `cast` installed and accessible in your PATH.

4. **Install Dependencies**
   - Install the necessary Node.js packages and other dependencies.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Download Chainlink Brownie Contracts**
   - Install the Chainlink Brownie contracts as a dependency.
   ```bash
    forge install smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@0.6.1
   ```

6. **Install OpenZeppelin Contracts**
   - Install OpenZeppelin contracts using `foundry`.
   ```bash
   forge install @openzeppelin/contracts
   ```
   
   

### Compilation

Compile the smart contracts using Foundry:

```bash
forge build
```

### Running Tests

Run the tests to ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
forge test
```

### Deploying to a Test Network

To deploy the contracts to a test network, you'll need to configure your deployment scripts. Ensure you have a `.env` file with the necessary environment variables such as your RPC URL and private keys. An example `.env` file:

```env
RPC_URL="https://eth-goerli.alchemyapi.io/v2/YOUR_API_KEY"
PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
```

Deploy the contracts using the configured scripts:

```bash
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
```
